A user-friendly, GUI-based shop plugin for Spigot/Bukkit servers. BsruShop allows server owners to easily create categorized shops where players can buy items through an intuitive interface.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Categorized Shops**: Organize items into different shop categories for easy navigation.
- **Interactive Purchase GUI**: A dynamic menu allows players to select the exact quantity they wish to purchase.
- **Highly Configurable**: Almost everything can be customized, including all messages, sounds, and GUI layouts via the `config.yml` file.
- **Vault Integration**: Hooks into Vault to support any economy plugin.
- **Easy In-Game Management**: Add or remove items from the shop using simple admin commands.

## üì¶ Dependencies

- **[Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)**: Required for economy integration. You will also need an economy plugin like **EssentialsX**.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  Download the latest version of the `BsruShop.jar` file.
2.  Ensure you have **Vault** and an economy plugin (e.g., EssentialsX) installed.
3.  Place the `BsruShop.jar` file into your server's `/plugins` directory.
4.  Restart or reload your server. The configuration files will be generated automatically.
5.  Configure the `config.yml` and `items.yml` files to your liking.
